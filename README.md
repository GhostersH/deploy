# Parking tickets

A completely functional clothing store for users to create their account and order some cool shirts!

Heroku deployment [HERE!](https://parking-tickets-lc.herokuapp.com/)

Made in React and Express

## Core project

The project consists of two apps, the backend API and the frontend. The backend has the following endpoints: 

- /api/health, GET: Just returns "ok" to check the API status.
- /api/people, POST, a date as body: Filters the people by its expiry ticket date using the passed date inserted in the client app. 
- /api/people, GET: Returns all the people data registered.

Using the web app, you could look at the whole registry of people that have bought tickets, and you could filter them by passing a date, which will return all the people with a ticket expiry date later than the date inserted. This will gather all the people data including how many tickets the have remaining until today (the date when fetched). It wont print the people with 0 or less tickets remaining.
